TurtleBot3 (An open source Robot from Robotis)(Humble--Version)
## Steps to Repeat the same 
Clone the Repository and  Before Building it install ROS2 Humble and Nav2 packages You can get sufficient Guidelines from the Official Wikis of Both 
### Steps - SLAM
You will need to install the slam_toolbox package:
```
$ sudo apt install ros-humble-slam-toolbox
```
### 1. Start your robot
This will be specific to your own robot.
Example with simulation:
```
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```

The Gazebo world with static Obstacles i.e Beams in the world 
### 2. Start Controlling Robot using Robot Steering Package 
```
$ rqt_robot_steering
```

### 3. Start SLAM with slam_toolbox
```
$ ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py use_sim_time:=True
```
### 4. Start Rviz
```
$ ros2 launch nav2_bringup rviz.launch.py
```

### 5. Generate and save your map
Make the robot move in the environment (specific to your own robot) and  for Saving the map:
```
$ ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/my_map
```
and you can even use slam toolbox plugin in rviz to save the map it will be saved in the default terminal location

-- Use Terminator for easy access 
# Steps - Navigation
### 1. Start your robot
Example with simulation:
```
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```

### 2. Start the main Navigation2 launch file
```
$ ros2 launch nav2_bringup bringup_launch.py map:=path/to/map.yaml
```
(add use_sim_time:=True if using Gazebo)
### 3. Start RViz
```
$ ros2 launch nav2_bringup rviz.launch.py
```

### 4. Send navigation commands
Use the **“2D Pose Estimate”** button to set the initial pose

and the **“2D GOAL POSE ”** button to send navigation goals.

### 5. Autonomous Navigation and Path Generated

The Green color Line is the Path Generated by NAV2 Stack  and  The pink color is the cost map and You can see our robot in action , The robot can Move Autonomosuly avoiding obstacles in the way , The obstacles are detected by the Lidar and form a reasonable cost cloud , This process was all done by the AMCL Package which was default localization in NAV2 Package along with that we have a DWB Local planner which will take care of obstacles and creating a safe path.
